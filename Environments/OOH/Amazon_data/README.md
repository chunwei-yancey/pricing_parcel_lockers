# Amazon dataset

This folder contains data with the Amazon dataset, for more information see: https://doi.org/10.1287/trsc.2022.1173

We enriched this dataset with OOH point data from Amazon. The data contains coordinates and distance matrices of the depot, parcelpoints, and the demand locations.

The first location is always the depot.
For Austin, the last 278 rows are the parcelpoints.
For Seattle, the last 299 rows are the parcelpoints.
